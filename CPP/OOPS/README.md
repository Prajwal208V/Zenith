OOPS:-OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is the programming paradigm that is defined using objects. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have some characteristics and behaviors.

advantages of using OOPs:-
          -OOPs is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems.
          -Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.
          -OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.
          -OOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.
          -OOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down approach
          -Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility in OOPs
          
main features of OOPs:- 
        Inheritance
        Encapsulation
        Polymorphism
        Data Abstraction
