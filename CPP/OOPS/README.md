üëΩOOPS:-OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is the programming paradigm that is defined using objects. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have some characteristics and behaviors.

üëΩWhy is OOPs so popular:-
OOPs programming paradigm is considered as a better style of programming. Not only it helps in writing a complex piece of code easily, but it also allows users to handle and maintain them easily as well. Not only that, the main pillar of OOPs - Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism, makes it easy for programmers to solve complex 

üëΩadvantages of using OOPs:-
          -OOPs is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems.
          -Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.
          -OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.
          -OOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.
          -OOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down approach
          -Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility in OOPs
          
üëΩmain features of OOPs:- 
        Inheritance
        Encapsulation
        Polymorphism
        Data Abstraction
        
üëΩWhat is a class?
A class is template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as member data or member, and some set of rules, known as behaviors or functions. So when an object is created, it automatically takes the data and functions that are defined in the class.
Therefore the class is basically a template or blueprint for objects. Also one can create as many objects as they want based on a class.
For example, first, a car‚Äôs template is created. Then multiple units of car are created based on that template

üëΩWhat is an object?
An object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the members and behaviors defined in the class template. In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereas class is just the blueprint for that object. So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behavior.
For example, a specific car.

üëΩWhat is encapsulation?
all the necessary data and methods are bind together and all the unnecessary details are hidden to the normal user. So Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and methods of a program together to do a specific job, without revealing unnecessary details.
Encapsulation can also be defined in two different ways:
1) Data hiding:hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member of an object.
2) Data binding: binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a class.

üëΩWhat is Polymorphism?(Polymorphism refers to the process by which some code, data, method, or object behaves differently under different circumstances or contexts)
Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word ‚Äúpoly‚Äù means many and ‚Äúmorphs‚Äù means forms, So it means many forms.
Types of polymorphism:-
         Compile-time Polymorphism.
         Runtime Polymorphism.

Compile time polymorphism, also known as Static Polymorphism, refers to the type of Polymorphism that happens at compile time.it means is that the compiler decides what kind of action or method or value has to be taken by the entity in the picture.

Runtime polymorphism, also known as Dynamic Polymorphism, refers to the type of Polymorphism that happens at the run time. it means is it can't be decided by the compiler. Therefore what kind of action or method or value has to be taken depends upon the execution.
 
üëΩWhat is meant by Inheritance? (inherits properties from another class)
inheritance is the mechanism by which an object or class (referred to as a child) is created using the definition of another object or class (referred to as a parent). Inheritance not only helps to keep the implementation simpler but also helps to facilitate code reuse

üëΩ What is Abstractionshows‚Äù only essential attributes and ‚Äúhides‚Äù unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts.
