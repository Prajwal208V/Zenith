### Searching Algorithms

<P>Searching Algorithms are designed to <em>check for an 'element' or 'retrieve' an element</em> from any data structure where it is stored </P>
<p>these algorithms are generally classified into two categories: </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Sequential Search:</b>  In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. </li>
  <li><b>Interval Search:</b> These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear    Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.</li>
</ol>
## Searching Algorithms :
  <ol>
    <li><b>Linear Search: </b>
      A simple approach is to do a linear search
            <ul>
              <li>Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]</li>
              <li>If x matches with an element, return the index.</li>
              <li>If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.</li>
            </ul>
      <em>The time complexity of the liner Serach algorithm is O(n).</em>
