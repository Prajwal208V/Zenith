### Searching Algorithms

<P>Searching Algorithms are designed to <em>check for an 'element' or 'retrieve' an element</em> from any data structure where it is stored </P>
<p>these algorithms are generally classified into two categories: </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Sequential Search:</b>  In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. </li>
  <li><b>Interval Search:</b> These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear    Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.</li>
</ol>
